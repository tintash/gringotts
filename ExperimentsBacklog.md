# Experiments 
    
## AI for Games

* [Realtime Adaptive Music Through ML (https://github.com/tintash/gringotts/tree/master/RnD_Experiments/Adaptive_Music_Generation) - Use ML to generate adaptive music in real time for games. This experiment is about using the data about the game elements and events on the screen to generate music that suits the mood of the game.

## NLP Research

* [Text Summarization] (https://github.com/tintash/gringotts/tree/master/RnD_Experiments/Text_Summarization) - To research the natural language generation area for text summarization. The goal for this is to figure out what quality of results are possible through text generation for various summarization tasks.
